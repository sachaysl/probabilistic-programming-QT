Probabilistic programming - a voyage of discovery

This is an attempt to learn more about probabilistic programming by creating my
own language.

The language is called QT and is based on the probabilistic programming language
called Church. For the time being I am following the Church tutorial found at http://v1.probmods.org/ and implementing the relevant functions in OCaml (see probability.ml)

I will also experiment with using simulations to provide answers to probability problems.

cancer-cluster.ml provides an answer to a problem on randomness posted by Nassim Nicholas Taleb on twitter.

wilensky.ml provides an answer to a counter-intuitive problem posed by the computer scientist Uri Wilensky.
